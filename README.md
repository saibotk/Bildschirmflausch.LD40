Welcome to our first LD participation:  
  
![c86a.gif](///raw/35b/c/z/d3b5.gif)
  
You are a small and insignificant intern. Your job is to bring coffee to everyone and do insignificant tasks.  
  
**HOW TO PLAY / TRICKS:**  
 - sometimes other interactable objects (like other NPCs) block the ability to interact. Just try pressing e and find the spot, sorry ;)  
 - You will need to interact with various things, like the coffeemachine to fill your coffeepot.  
 - For the first quest, you'll need to pick up the watering can by pressing **e**.  
 - On the right top corner all active quests are listed.
 - At the beginning, you only work on the ground floor. As time passes, you will also have to do jobs in higher floors. This is also reflected by changes in the music  
  
**CONTROLS:**  
 - use **a, d, w, s** to move **left, right, up, down (elevator)**.
 - use **e** to interact.
 - use **q** to swap the inventory items.

**Gameplay:**
 - Fulfill the tasks, before the time runs out. Therefore collect items like the broom or wateringcan with "e".  
 - On success will get another task.  
 - Two more tasks on failure.  
 - If you lag behind with your tasks or your colleagues run out of coffee, you get fired. Have fun!  

As in real life, there is no end to your internship. Just try to keep it as long as possible â€¦

**Background info:**  
 - All assets / audio were made during the game.  
 - We used Unity3D as the gameengine and had some struggle while trying to sync our project with git (seems like gitignore doesn't like spaces in betweem foldernames or i just dont know what went wrong).  

**Post-LD Bugfixes/QoL changes:**  
Inventory    
 - LetterBundle will now be deleted if empty  
 - Can't pick up an item twice  
GUI  
 - Added indicators to dirtspots
 - Added "Jobs" above QuestList
 - Added a background to the counter to be able to read the counter
 - MainMenu items are now responsive to screen size
 - Deathscreen dark overlay also responsive
 - QuestList now adds, removes and positions items correctly
 - Added coffee low warning text
 - Added timer sprite to quests
